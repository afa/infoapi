Part of this use is of course touristic. Argentina will amaze any traveler with spectacular beaches, wonderful waterfalls, imposing peaks of the Ands and versatile cities. \\n The first of these cities to be visited is certainly Buenos Aires, the capital and largest city of Argentina. The main tourist attraction is La Boca, the old port district that still maintains its 19th-century ambience. The local houses are painted in all shades of rainbow, and behind their doors there are cafés, restaurants and souvenir shops. \\n In the heart of Buenos Aires towers the Obelisk, icon of the capital and national historical monument. Located in the Plaza de la Republica, it was built in 1936 to commemorate the city 400th anniversary. Another important sight to visit is the Colon Theater. Architecturally, it is an example of pure Renaissance; culturally, it is the key venue of many artistic events. \\nArgentina is one of the leader countries in the list of UNESCO World Heritage. Los Glaciares National Park and Iguazu National Park are of greatest importance to both Argentina and the planet. The everlasting glaciers and magnificent waterfalls are truly natural wonders of the world. Other tourist attractions offered by the geology of Argentina are Ischigualasto Provincial Park and Talampaya National Park. The landscape of these places is thousands of years old; among the marks of the epochs long gone are the fossils of dinosaurs. The Calchaqui Valley and Quebrada de Humahuaca are excursions for those who are not afraid of heights. \\n Argentina is especially proud of it closeness to the South Pole which is most evident on the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. This transition from the sunny shore to the snowy reach is almost magical! When you have experienced enough cold and fabulous view, you can return to the warmth and water of the Mar del Plata, which is Spanish for “the silver sea”. This resort is a huge contrast to all abovementioned natural marvels. \\nEvery country is unique but Argentina is one of the richest in its uniqueness.

As your tram journey goes on, you’ll see Parliament House of Victoria and lots of other popular places.\\nThe culinary capital of the world.

The place in the city, which has always been popular is the Markt (Market Square). Carven facades of gingerbread houses are standing along the square as if they were a film set for some fairy-tale. Take a bike-tour round city attractions and then go to Basilica of the Holy Blood.

It’s said that that in difficult times, times of wars and diseases the dried blood turned in to liquid again. Keep on getting to know the city and 366 stairs later you’ll hold your breath beacuse of the view in front of your eyes - you’re on the top of the bell tower Belfort, and Bruges, tiny, fairytale Bruges spreads out before you.

The Last Judgment and the afterlife. Guilt. Sins. Hell and Heaven.” \\nBut no matter how perfect Bruges is for collecting one’s thoughts and searching for inner harmony, it seems that the city was built to be the place for romance.

Present your other half with famous Belgium chocolate which goes in any colour or shape, order some delicious Belgium beer and then happy and stuffed go to the Markt. Practically every summer evening music comes from the top of Belfort. Sounds of Mozart and Bach, sounds of love and tragedy, music that echoes across the rooftops and, fusing into one with city noise, will make your heart beat faster.

And when in replay you’ll hear Canada it may seem a bit odd to you. But in fact if you look at Montreal more closely, you’ll learn that there’s no city that might be so french, not at least in the Western Hemisphere. \\n Always wanted to see Notre Dame de Paris? Montreal has its own -  Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal. This Canadian church is as grand (if not more so) as its French brother. The sound of its 11-ton bass bell, called “Jean-Baptiste”, can be heard for a distance of 10 miles. The interior decoration is beyond description: stained glass windows, sculptures of saints, wood carvings and a tremendous pipe organ.  \\nThe city is considered to be the world cultural heritage, and  it was named a UNESCO city of design. There are more than 30 museums in Montreal: Montreal Museum of Fine Arts,  Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal (a museum of contemporary art), Redpath Museum of Natural History and others.

Get ready to tell your friends about acrobatic skills of actors and spectacular show from dawn till dusk, because you will. But Montreal is well-known not only for Cirque du Soleil.

After such a dessert you just have to paint a maple leaf on one of your cheeks and go to cheer for Montreal Canadiens (Les Canadiens de Montréal).  Even the most loyal fans of your country’s hockey teams will envy you. \\n  There is the one place in the city, the memories of which will be saved in your memory in one picturesque shot - the view from Mount Royal, after which, by the way, the city was named. The city skyline, as overlooked from this veiwpot, will give you chills.

    "content": "{\"annotation\":\" What can be more striking than a trip to the country of the rising Sun? Japanese culture, its values and mentality are extremely different from European ones. Japanese character amazingly combines grace, scrupulousness and strict hierarchy with the tendency to stand out and shock. Japanese, and especially Tokian schoolgirls and young people often remind anime or comics characters with their hair styles, make-up and clothing manner. Most vivid and trendy representatives like to gather on the bridge in the Harajuku district in Tokyo. \\n  Tokyo \\nThe capital of Japan is Tokyo which, strictly speaking, is not a city but metropolitan prefecture – the only one of its kind – situated on the Honshu island and a couple of smaller islands. Its area is just a little smaller than of Moscow’s but the density of population is higher. It’s an expensive and populous megalopolis, heavily stacked with skyscrapers. Shinjuku district is especially striking with its brightly illuminated skyscrapers, Golden Gai and geisha district. \\n Business life. \\nBusiness activity is boisterous in Tokyo as it’s one of the three main financial centres in the world along New York and London. People are always in a hurry here. Take, for instance, complex Shibuya crossroad – it speaks volumes about the rhythm of life here. \\n Cuisine. \\nWe could not help mentioning the Japanese cuisine that has become highly popular in Russia today. Japanese cuisine is a remarkably healthy one. Still European palate may not be very accustomed to it: raw fish, hot spices, deserts with extremely exotic taste. The Japanese look after their health a lot and Japanese cuisine and obsession with fitness are the main reasons of such a great number of long-livers. Don’t miss the chance to experience eating habits of the Japanese but be ready that some of the restaurants do not serve foreigners. Nevertheless, the ordinary Japanese are very hearty and helpful people. To add to that even more, Tokyo is considered the safest megalopolis in the world.   \\n  Sightseeing attractions. \\nTokyo keeps its history records from the 12th century, that’s why the territory of metropolitan prefecture is abundant in cultural and historical monuments. Most popular among them are the Emperor’s Palace and pagoda of the Buddhist temple Zojo-ji. \\n There is a possibility to see the city from the bird’s-eye view from the TV tower, highest in the world, with the symbolic name “Tokyo Skytree”. The big wheel “Palette Town” will raise you 100 m above the ground within a couple of minutes. Still if you want to get a connection with the real life and people here you better go straight to the Ginza district, the centre of fashion in Tokyo. \\n If you’ve got kids be sure to visit Tokyo’s Disneyland! This fairy-tale country is really enormous so the tourists choose to move around by means of special transport. The shows and attractions will delight both adults and children alike! \\n  \",\"map\":\"place/japan,tokyo\"}",

Among the islands splitting the sea there it stretches - winding, queer and stunning with its looks - the Atlantic Road. Quite often you can see the whales there, in their most common environment. But even you are not as lucky as to see them the opening view still compensates the pains taken to get there. \\n Extreme sport lovers are best to come to this Road in autumn as storms and gales start to disturb it heavily during this time. \\n Trolltunga, the Troll’s tongue. It’s a ledge of a cliff situated above the lake near the town of Odda. It overhangs the water surface at the height of 800 m and reminds of a tongue with its shape. You can reach it by cable car or simply walking up the Skjeggedal Mountain. It’s rather far-distanced and tiresome to reach but having climbed up unto the Troll’s Tongue you will face a sight you won’t ever forget. Majestic view and emotional excitement will make you forget all the pains of the way up. \\n Urnes Stave Church. It is attributed to one of the UNESCO monuments. It was erected in 1130 and has kept on its vaults unique carved panels that go back to 1050. These frescoes are wonderfully preserved cultural elements known as “animal style”. Carvings of Urnes cannot be described in words: wave-like, irregular patterns with a shape of a lion on deer’s legs being the dominating. This ancient art somehow brings together grotesque and myth, reality and dreams, existence and aspirations. \\n Talking of all the natural wonders of Norway, as well as man-made ones, can go for hours long.

However, in the middle of the same century a person named Walt Disney bought land in Anaheim and made this land Disneyland, the first entertainment park of its kind. After two years of construction (1953-1955) the gates of the magic castle opened for all children and parents. Nowadays, Disneyland is the most popular entertainment park in the word. \\nTourists have become fond of Anaheim thanks to its sport and entertainment facilities. In the course of few last decades parks, amusement rides, gaming and sporting grounds had been built in plenty. The king of Anaheim's attractions is, again, Disneyland. The word is not accidental; Disneyland is indeed a kingdom with its own administrative division. Each part of the park is dedicated to a certain kind of amusement, or to a popular piece of culture, or to some random theme. There are the Main Street, Land of Fantasies, the New-Orleans Square, Land of Pioneers, Land of Tomorrow and special areas for fans of Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Carribbean, Tarzan and other characters from movies and cartoons. And at this variety doesn't deplete: there also are golf courses, tennis courts, hippodromes, sport arenas and tracks for rentable roller skaters and bicycles.\\nIn 1993 Anaheim saw the grand opening of the sport complex \\\"Anaheim Arena\\\". In 2006 Honda acquired naming rights, and the complex became \\\"Honda-center\\\", but the essence didn't change: the place continued to host events of various kinds. Fans of sport may remember the World Badminton Championship in 2005 and Stanley Cup Finals in 2007, while fans of music know that many singers and bands have been to Anaheim. Among them, Davd Bowie, Aerosmith, Shakira, Depeche Mode, Mariah Carrie, Phil Collins, Madonna, Celine Dion, Metallica, Britney Spears, The Kiss, Barbara Streisand, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, The Rolling Stones, Jennifer Lopes and many others. In addition to that, \\\"Honda-center\\\" is a home arena of the local professional hockey team \\\"Anaheim Ducks\\\". By the way, it was Walt Disney's company that founded the club. So, everything is interconnected in the glorious city of Anaheim.\\n\",\"map\":\"place/united-states,anaheim\"}",

When you have visited all these places, you may go relax on one of the numerous beaches or in one of the spacious parks. By the way, the capital’s maim park, Parque Rodo, combines these two as it is situated right on the shore! In this place, exotic features like colorful parrots and magnificent marine views intersect with urban features like perfect lawns and alleys. Montevideo is one city that is versatile enough to enjoy every aspect of it!\\n\",\"map\":\"place/uruguay,montevideo-department,montevideo\"}",

This city is the wonderful blend of old and modern, Asian and European, eternal and everyday, which makes Hanoi one of the most popular tourist attractions.\\n The Old Quarter of the city is named “36 Old Streets”. In Hanoi’s first years of existence, merchants conducted their operations along these streets. Depending on which guild owned the trade, they were called the Silk, Silver, Sugar, Paper, Jewel, Tin streets. These and thirty more names live on in the Old Quarter of Hanoi. Local houses have unusually narrow facades and rooms, which makes them look like tunnels. The main landmark of the “36 Old Streets” is the Temple of the White Horse. Legends hold it that King Lee saw a horse there that showed him where the walls of the city should be raised.\\n The modern part of Hanoi is represented by wide avenues, spacious parks and colossal skyscrapers.

Not only is it the city’s gothic crown but also one of the catholic centers in Asia.

It’s widely famous with its dazzling white beaches and the old town which is included in UNESCO’s World Heritage site Fund. Chinese influence can be read everywhere: tiled roofs and narrow streets.\\n In Hoi An you can come across some houses that are more than 300 years old. The Meeting Hall, which was built in 1776 by the Chinese, will make you hold your breath with its intricate wooden carvings. The Chuc Thanh Pagoda is the oldest in the city. All the trips around Hoi An usually start with it. The Japanese Covered Bridge is yet another place of interest. It was built in 16th century to join the Japanese community with the China town. The roof was a protection against rains and scorching sun. It’s a mighty and sturdy construction because this region is subject to earthquakes. One side of the bridge sports figures of two dogs, another – two monkeys. The legend says the bridge building was started in the year of monkey and finished in the year of the dog. Another sightseeing object is the Tran’s Chapel. The Tran’s family moved to Hoi An from China about 300 years ago and introduced an impact on the city’s history and architecture.\\n\",\"map\":\"place/vietnam,quang-nam,hoi-an\"}",
