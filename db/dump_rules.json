Part of this use is of course touristic. Argentina will amaze any traveler with spectacular beaches, wonderful waterfalls, imposing peaks of the Ands and versatile cities. \\n The first of these cities to be visited is certainly Buenos Aires, the capital and largest city of Argentina. The main tourist attraction is La Boca, the old port district that still maintains its 19th-century ambience. The local houses are painted in all shades of rainbow, and behind their doors there are cafés, restaurants and souvenir shops. \\n In the heart of Buenos Aires towers the Obelisk, icon of the capital and national historical monument. Located in the Plaza de la Republica, it was built in 1936 to commemorate the city 400th anniversary. Another important sight to visit is the Colon Theater. Architecturally, it is an example of pure Renaissance; culturally, it is the key venue of many artistic events. \\nArgentina is one of the leader countries in the list of UNESCO World Heritage. Los Glaciares National Park and Iguazu National Park are of greatest importance to both Argentina and the planet. The everlasting glaciers and magnificent waterfalls are truly natural wonders of the world. Other tourist attractions offered by the geology of Argentina are Ischigualasto Provincial Park and Talampaya National Park. The landscape of these places is thousands of years old; among the marks of the epochs long gone are the fossils of dinosaurs. The Calchaqui Valley and Quebrada de Humahuaca are excursions for those who are not afraid of heights. \\n Argentina is especially proud of it closeness to the South Pole which is most evident on the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. This transition from the sunny shore to the snowy reach is almost magical! When you have experienced enough cold and fabulous view, you can return to the warmth and water of the Mar del Plata, which is Spanish for “the silver sea”. This resort is a huge contrast to all abovementioned natural marvels. \\nEvery country is unique but Argentina is one of the richest in its uniqueness.

Keep on getting to know the city and 366 stairs later you’ll hold your breath beacuse of the view in front of your eyes - you’re on the top of the bell tower Belfort, and Bruges, tiny, fairytale Bruges spreads out before you. It’s like a model of a medieval town breathing with real people and transport. \\nThe Middle Ages is well-known both for its majesty and for its gloominess. The Groeningemuseum will open the door to the dark side of that time. The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse sculpture near the museum, and the gallery itself houses paintings by Flemish artists, with such masterpieces as diptych “The Judgment of Cambyses” by Gerard David and triptych “The Last Judgment” by Hieronymus Bosch among them.When gazing into details of these works, one can’t help but ask himself: “Do  you believe in all that stuff? The Last Judgment and the afterlife. Guilt. Sins. Hell and Heaven.” \\nBut no matter how perfect Bruges is for collecting one’s thoughts and searching for inner harmony, it seems that the city was built to be the place for romance. Swans? - Countless! Canal tours? - If it pleases you! (It’s no wonder that sometimes the city is called a “the Venice of the North”.) Present your other half with famous Belgium chocolate which goes in any colour or shape, order some delicious Belgium beer and then happy and stuffed go to the Markt. Practically every summer evening music comes from the top of Belfort. Sounds of Mozart and Bach, sounds of love and tragedy, music that echoes across the rooftops and, fusing into one with city noise, will make your heart beat faster. And you’ll think \\\"I know I’m awake but it feels like I’m in a dream.\\\" \\n\",\"map\":\"place/belgium,brugge\"}",

The island is a part of the Jardines del Rey archipelago which is included into the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. \\n The Cayo Santa Maria Island is conventionally divided into two parts: the north one with the beaches and the south one with the hotels. In between them, by the Barcelo Cayo Santa Maria Hotel there is the main place of interest here – a tourist village Pueblo La Estrella. Here tourists can relax in atmospheric Cuban bars and cafes, shop for souvenirs and visit spa salons. \\n Cayo Santa Maria’s beaches are open for public and you can freely choose any spot of the 6.5 km long beach to sunbathe and swim. The sea has got its peculiar feature here – the waters are always a bit rough, and small storms are quite common here. \\n Among most popular excursions on Cayo Santa Maria are trips to other archipelago islands. We recommend visiting small Cayo Ensenachos Island with the only hotel there - Occidental Royal Hideaway, and two beaches, Ensenachos and El Megano, which are considered to be the most beautiful on Cuba. A trip to the fishermen’s village, Caibarien, would be a quite an expedition, as well as a visit to a small Remedios village where they’ve got their own church. \\n\",\"map\":\"place/cuba,cayo-santa-maria\"}",

During World War II the city was being bombed, and nearly whole Cologne was wiped off from the face of the earth, but the only one building did not suffer miraculously – Cologne Cathedral, due to the fact that it was a kind of an orienting point for pilots. If there is such a wish, any tourist can climb the stairs to the top of the South Tower. It will take about an hour and require considerable effort. Sightseeing of the cathedral is prohibited during a mass. Entrance to the Cathedral is free, but visitors are always reminded about the donation. \",\"map\":\"place/germany,koeln\"}",

Around them there are wonderful British parks, and they are worth a visit even just for the stunning scenery. \\nArt Gallery, which houses paintings of the old masters and exemplars of contemporary art, impresses with the wealth of collection.

And it is not because the city did not want to restore the zoo, but because residents of Dusseldorf kept in such a way the memory of the most brutal war in human history.

The Corfu Cathedral amazingly accommodates to denominations inside: the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox. The exterior is modest but the insides keep some Eastern Orthodox icons of Byzantine and Greek masters, and the remains of St. Theodora, empresses of the Byzantine Empire. A couple of decades the Cathedral was patronized by Russian emperors. \\n Eastern Orthodox Pantocratoros monastery on Pontikonisi, a small island near Corfu, was also presented by the Byzantine. Its name is translated as “mouse’s tale” and originated from the looks of the stairs. \\n The most impressive construction left by the Venetians is the Angelokastro Castle. Towering high to the skies and emerging right from the cliff, the castle reminds of the dark ages of pirates' and Ottoman's terror. Corfu has always been a tasty morsel and even Admiral Ushakov’s squadron had protected the island from the Turks and the French.

Moreover, those who prefer night walks will find out the real beauty of the city. \\nSpeaking of the architecture, we should mention the river Liffey where one can observe several bridges of completely different shape and style. For instance, the true symbol of Ireland - Samuel Beckett Bridge was designed in the form of a harp, as this instrument is a kind of emblem of Ireland, which can be found everywhere: on coins, coat of arms, passport, etc. \\n  Another “Irish thing”, of course, is the Leprechaun Museum devoted to the concept of these national mystical characters. Malahide Castle would be interesting for those visitors who want to touch ancient relics, for the Construction preserved its original appearance from the outside as well as from the inside. \\nNeedless to say that there are many hotels, entertainment centers, restaurants, clubs, museums in Dublin, as in any other European capital city.

So if you want to enjoy a comfortable vacation and great sea views, Marbella is perfect for you. Open-air concerts, fresh seafood prepared in your presence in a cafe on the seafront ... Sounds great, but it's not all that can be offered by the resort town and the region of Andalusia, in which it is located. \\n In Marbella you can see works of Picasso and Dali, visit the 17th century church Iglesia de Santa Maria da la Encarnacion. \\n Lovers of history and archeology will be able to see the Roman mosaics in Villa de Rio Verde and the baths of the 3rd century. At 60 kilometers from Marbella there is a large Andalusian city of Malaga, the birthplace of Pablo Picasso. \\n Architectural and historical sights of Andalusia really deserve special attention. \\n  \",\"map\":\"place/spain,marbella\"}",

Lanzarote is the most eastern of Canary Islands, and its main attraction is Playa Blanca – the newest and promising resort. Once there used to be a small fishing village, but now it’s the resort, which stretches for miles, and there are numerous hotels, bars, restaurants and shops. \\n In Spanish Playa Blanca means “White Beach” and this name is completely deserved if we speak of three main city beaches. Playas de Papagayo - this name unites several stunning beaches half a kilometer from Playa Blanca. Bays with crystal clear greenish water, white sand and gentle waves attract tourists in spite of the fact that each resort town of the island has its own beaches. In the center of Playa Blanca there is a small natural beach only one step away from the promenade. To the east there is a wide well-equipped Playa Dorada beach where differnt resort entertainments are waiting for tourists. The beach is safe with breakwaters. \\n Playa Blanca has another tourist attraction - Marina Rubicon where the snow-white yachts, which bring tourists to the island, float. You will find not only shops and restaurants with great national cuisine at the port, but also a small art gallery. \\n The architectural and historical attraction of the island is Castillo de las Coloradas – the watchtower built in the XVIII century on the rocky cape. It’s preserved up to now and is on the emblem of Playa Blanca. \\n\",\"map\":\"place/spain,playa-blanca\"}",
